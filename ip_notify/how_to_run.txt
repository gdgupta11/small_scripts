What it does ? 
If you are running nginx on any of your servers and need to monitor logs periodically that what response codes people are getting or 
whether they are abusing or scraping your blog or webpage, you can use this. This is not real time but sends your consolidated report of all
response codes against IP addresses acessing them every hour.

It sends out emails only when if someone is accessing your page more than 10 times, that is configurable in script. If it is less than that
then it will log details in /var/log/logging_notifyip_address.log ( make sure of permissions of this file )

1) Need to install the required python packages using requirement.txt file, if you are doing that using virtualenv, that is best. 

2) Need to have a gmail account from which you will be sending emails to your admin account. 

3) Need to set this gmail account ID and password in your os environment. You can set them permanently in your shell environment in .bashrc file.

4) Once above is set then you should be good to go. 

5) You can run this using cron also every hour automatically, for that you need to set cron job to run every hour. Cronjob has a issue that
it cannot access your environment variables because when it runs it does not have any shell. So for fixing that you need to fix your .bashrc file where
it does not spawn shell for non users. Else you can directly mention gmail user ID and password in file ( which is not recommeded way of doing it )

Example : 

02 * * * * source $HOME/.bashrc; /export/home/user1/small_scripts/flask/bin/python /export/home/user1/small_scripts/notify_ipaddress.py
